Transform the way you experience music with GestureFlow - the revolutionary app that lets you control audio playback using nothing but your hands.

GestureFlow uses Apple's advanced Machine Vision technology to track your hand movements in real-time. Simply position both hands in front of your device's camera and watch as your gestures instantly control pitch and playback speed.

• LEFT HAND: Control pitch by pinching your thumb and index finger together or spreading them apart
• RIGHT HAND: Adjust playback speed using the same intuitive pinch gestures
• AUTO-CALIBRATION: Lost tracking? Just remove your hand and bring it back for instant rebalancing
